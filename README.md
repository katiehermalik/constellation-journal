# Finch collector lab - Views and Templates

The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except you'll collect something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever.

- Fork and clone this repo
- Pick a reource. (Dogs, Cards, Stamps, etc)
- Initialize your project. (Do not forget your .env)
- Create your db. 
- Configure your application to connect to the db.
(Dont forget to use startapp to get your application folder and include it in your settings.py)
- Create a home route, about route, and index route. 
- Create a template view that extends a base for all the routes. 


Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should **create it outside of the class repo** so that you can make it a repo in your personal GitHub account.
